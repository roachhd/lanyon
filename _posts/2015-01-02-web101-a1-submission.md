### Question & Answer

**Question 1.**
**What is the Internet?**

   The Internet is an interconnected computer network on a global scale that uses the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices. It consists of millions of private, public, organisational, academic, business, and government networks, linked by a massive infrastructure of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 

   The Internet provides a foundation to carry an extensive range of information resources and services such as text, graphics, voice, video, and computer programs and more. These are transmitted via HTTP and viewed through a web browser.

**Question 2.**
**What is the World Wide Web?**

   The World Wide Web consists mostly of HTML files, which are specially formatted documents that can contain information, instructions for the web browser, links, as well as images and other media. All web browsers can interpret HTML files and render the information when requested by users. 

   In addition to HTML, it's common for websites to use technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to render to visual style of a website and JavaScript for more advanced functionality. The World Wide Web is an ever growing collection of these HTML documents which reside on web servers. The interlinked documents that make up the World Wide Web are accessed via the Internet.

**Question 4.**
**What are three purported differences between the World Wide Web as it first emerged, and the more recent Web 2.0?**

   With Web 1.0 there was limited interaction between sites and web users, they were simply an information source where users were provided with that information. There was little chance of interactive or participation. 

Static web pages were used mostly to build and display web pages in 1990 when the World Wide Web first emerged. Unlike the highly interactive and social networks of today, participation by users was limited mostly to retrieval of information. 
Today with Web 2.0 user engagement and participation is at the forefront of development. 

   Social networks, RSS feeds and blogging have transformed the web into a global community for content sharing, collaborating, and communication. Web 2.0 encourages user participation and provides rich user experiences and ability to contribute.


**Three major Differences**

Web 1.0  | Web 2.0
-------- | ------
Static   | Interactive/rich
Readable | Writable 
company controlled | user controlled

**Question 5.** 
**What is RSS and why is it significant to Web 2.0?**

RSS (Rich Site Summary) is an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format that allows content to be displayed on other websites and inside alternate formats. It allows for the delivery of regularly changing web content.

The flexibility of compressed information sources means that the information can be viewed in different ways on a variety of devices. RSS changes the relationship between the user and the information they want access to by allowing you to easily retreive the latest content from the sites you are interested in. You save time and protect your privacy, by not needing to join each site's subscription service.

 Today publishers syndicate their content as an RSS Feed to whoever wants it and often display a small icon with the RSS, XML, or RDF logo to show a feed is available.
