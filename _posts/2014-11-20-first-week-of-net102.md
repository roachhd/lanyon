######What's it ask about?

Here is where I'm going to out an intro to the subject and what I'm going to do on web one.


###Week 1 Checklist

Task   | Info    | Links   | Due   | Completed
------ | ------- | ------- | ----- | --------
Wake at 4:50 a.m.   | info on topic.  | [some links](htt://example.com)   | 28-11-14     | ✅
Drink water.   | info on topic.  | [some links](htt://example.com)   | 28-11-14     |     ❔ 
[Most Important Things (MITs) ][2]for today. | info on topic.  | [some links](htt://example.com)   | 28-11-14  | ❌ 


###A couple of explanations: [The MITs that I set for the day][2] concern at least one item towards one of my goals, and probably the 1-2 things I MUST complete at work. There will be more that I do during the day, but my focus will be to finish at least these three `MIT's`.

As for the exercise and meditate item, I have a schedule where I do one exercise each morning (with the exception of Fridays, where I plan to meditate for at least `10-15 minutes`). Actually, I also often exercise in the evenings too, so on some days I'll have two workouts – maybe a bike in the morning and swim in the evening, for example. My body is still getting used to this, so we'll see how it works out.

>As for waking up at 4:50 a.m., I have only just become an early riser. I [wrote more about that here][3].
