This week, please take time to look back at the six topics covered in Module One. You should use this time to catch up on any of the readings or activities you may have not yet completed before we move into Module Two where we will be building on these examples to develop and appreciation of the interaction between Power, Economy, Community and Identity and the Internet.

### READ:

This week's reading is from Mia Consalvo and Charles Ess's edited collection, The Handbook of Internet Studies, a very good book that deals with many of the topics of the unit which we recommend to supplement your reading and writing for this unit. It is available online through the Curtin library; search for the book title in the catalogue and navigate to the pdf of the chapter:

Bakardjieva, M. (2011). The Internet in Everyday Life: Exploring the Tenets and Contributions of Diverse Approaches. In M. Consalvo and C. Ess (Eds). The Handbook of Internet Studies (pp. 58-82). Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.

This chapter surveys the ways in which different scholars have conceptualized and analysed the intersection between the Internet and contemporary life. While some of it is quite complex, do not feel overwhelmed: the aim is not to have to learn every perspective in detail but simply have a broad understanding of the different possible ways of understanding how the Internet is situated in the everyday.

### DO:

To help you with your reflection, share your thoughts on Module One with other students. Are there any common themes running through what you've learned so far? Was there anything you were surprised by, or disagreed with? How can you connect one or two of the perspectives discussed by Bakardjieva to the topics covered so far?
