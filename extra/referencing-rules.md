# Internet Studies: Referencing

## Introduction

Throughout your course of study you will be involved in reading, discussion (both online and offline) and writing in various forms including web-based projects and presentations along with more traditional essay-style assignments. As you build your knowledge and engage with other students, you will naturally be drawing upon ideas and information that you have read about through your participation in the course, or that you have found independently. It is these ideas and pieces of information, coupled with your own faculties, that will enable you to expand your knowledge, develop critical thinking skills and begin to build your own ideas about the issues and topics covered in the course.

As you take these ideas and use them in your work, you are expected to acknowledge where you have drawn them from. This is referencing.

## **Why Reference?**

Well, in academic work, you should be referencing because you are required to. Not referencing the source of your ideas is a form of [plagiarism][1]. Plagiarism is a serious offence in the context of academic work.

However, there are a number of other reasons why referencing is important:

* It gives the reader a clear view of how you have built up your argument/idea.
* It demonstrates to the reader that your argument or idea is based upon having read widely and explored you topic thoroughly.
* It gives the reader the information required to further explore ideas that you have called upon.
* It is only fair to acknowledge other people when you have used their ideas.

**It's Good for the Reader**  
As you can see, the first three of these reasons are largely for the benefit of the reader. If you have referenced your work thoroughly, your reader will have a clear indication of how you developed your idea or argument. Not only does this make the work far easier to take in, it also gives the reader confidence in your work by demonstrating how thoroughly you have explored the particular topic. What's more, you have given the reader the information they need to independently pursue their own lines of enquiry.

**It's Good For You**  
The benefit for you is that your work will carry far more authority if it is referenced correctly. By demonstrating to the reader that you have thoroughly explored your topic your work becomes far more credible. People who read it will take your ideas on board far more easily and can, in turn, reference your work with the confidence that you have done your part in the knowledge-building process.

**It's The Right Thing To Do**  
Finally, and importantly, it is only ethical to acknowledge the source of your ideas and information. If someone has taken the time to develop an idea, it is unfair to claim this as your own. This is, in effect, what you are doing when you fail to reference correctly in an academic context.

## **Referencing â€“ The Rules**

There are three rules of referencing. If you follow them, you can be sure that your work will be referenced correctly:

1. You must include a reference **every time** you use someone else's ideas or information, when that information is not widely known.
2. You must include a reference when you:
    1. _Paraphrase_ (put someone else's idea in your own words)
    2. _Summarise _(put someone else's idea in your own words and in a reduced form)
    3. _Quote _(express someone else's idea in their exact words)
    4. _Copy _(reproduce an image, chart, graph or table from someone else's work)
3. A reference must appear in two places:
    1. In the body of your work (the **in-text citation**)
    2. In the reference list at the end of you work (this is where the full details are listed so the reader can find the document for themselves)

## **Some Examples**

There are many different referencing styles. Within Internet Studies, you will be using a form of referencing called APA (American Psychology Association).   
Each type of source text (i.e Journal article, newspaper, book, TV Show, web page etc.) has its own requirements for referencing. The specifics of how different sources are __ referenced using the APA style can be found [here][2].

Included below are a number of examples that should give you a good idea of how referencing is used.

**Referencing Information  
**Referencing information is relatively straightforward. You have come across information that you wish to use in your work. When you use the information, you include an in-text citation and a full reference at the end of your piece:

>   
On May 1st, 2009 Vodafone began rolling out a 3G network in Australia (Hewitt, 2009).
>
> **References**  
Hewitt, R. (2009). Vodafone extends its regional 3G network. Retrieved May 5th, 2009, from http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,28348,25412873-5014239,00.html

(Note: You'll see here that the URL of this Web page only appears in the reference list. A URL should **never** be part of the in-text citation.)

**Referencing Ideas  
**Referencing someone else's idea is a bit more complex as there are a variety of ways in which we can use ideas in writing. The most common, with examples, are shown below:

Example 1: Paraphrase

> Michael Froomkin (2000) has suggested that employers are continually looking for new ways to measure employee efficiency.

Example 2: Paraphrase

> Employers are always on the lookout for new methods of quantifying employee efficiency (Froomkin, 2000).

Example 3: Summarise

> Michael Froomkin (2000) has reviewed the way in which issues of privacy and surveillance are being affected by technological developments, suggesting that a legal response must come sooner rather than later.

Example 4: Summarise

> As our understandings of privacy and surveillance have been radically altered by technological developments, it is likely that a legal response will come sooner rather than later (Froomkin, 2000).

Example 5: Quote

> Michael Froomkin (2000, p.1463) has suggested that "employers continually seek new ways to monitor employees for efficiency and honesty".

Example 6: Quote

```
 In the age of Internet technology, "employers continually seek new ways to monitor employees for efficiency and honesty" (Froomkin, 2000, p.1463).
```

As you can see, in all of these examples, the writing and/or ideas of Michael Froomkin are referenced to allow the reader to refer to his original article if necessary. In addition to the in-text citations seen here, the reference list for the piece of work would include the full reference:

```
References
Froomkin, M. (2000). The Death of Privacy? _Stanford Law Review, 52_, 1461-1543.
```

## When To Reference

You need to reference all of the work you produce for your study. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Essays
* Discussion Board Postings
* Web-based Presentations

**Referencing Beyond University**

A final consideration is that you may want to consider providing references in your writing beyond your study at University.   
If you look back at the reasons why we employ referencing, you'll notice that none of them are really about academia as much as they are about making your writing more authoritative and ethical.   
Is there any reason why you would want your writing not to carry the kind of weight that referencing adds?  
Whether writing reports in a business environment or merely posting your latest ideas to your blog, referencing the work of others still achieves the same outcomes:

* It gives the reader a clear indication of how you have built up your argument/idea.
* It demonstrates to the reader that your argument or idea is based upon having read widely and explored you topic thoroughly.
* It gives the reader the information required to further explore ideas that you have called upon.
* It is only fair to acknowledge other people when you have used their ideas.

Referencing is not merely about keeping your lecturers and tutors happy. Referencing is the system by which accumulated knowledge is built.

**By using referencing in your work, you add strength to your argument, assist the reader and acknowledge your sources fairly.**
