I like these quotes:

“He who is contented is rich.” ~Lao Tzu

“Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.” ~Lao Tzu

“Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.” ~Marcus Aurelius Antoninus

“Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.” ~Epicurus

“When you are discontent, you always want more, more, more. Your desire can never be satisfied. But when you practice contentment, you can say to yourself, ‘Oh yes – I already have everything that I really need.'” ~Dalai Lama
