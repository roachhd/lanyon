###### Week One Notes ðŸŽ“ 

Whole to my week of reflections for web communications. This week was mostly an introduction to the topics we wife studying, in particular Topic 1. The Internet. 
This week's reading and activities had me thinking of a username and web presence that would form my online identity for [assignment 3](uni/web101/a3). I also tried to investigate how much of a web presence I currently have. Just as a few other students mentioned in the discussion boards, I [Googled](http://google.com) myself and came across some interesting search results. 
There area a couple of famous Katie Balls out there, a model from Sydney, a mud wrestler and an American Hogger bikini model (*can you see a pattern*). I also found way to much information about myself, none of it private, and ask I remember putting on the internet. But I was surprised to find my information on sites I had never seen before. For example my Instagram photos also site on several other photo sharing sites. The Instagram API is easily sealed and developer can make calls to retrieve any of your information they isn't specifically marked as private. Because my Instagram feed it's public, any developed using the Instagram API can address my pictures and display them in their site (* as long as it adheres to Instagrams terms and conditions*).

Anyway, back to the main topic of choosing a username. The main goal of the activity was to come up with a hand that could be used across several services to create an online presence.


I had meet heard of a site called Namechk which checks usernames over a huge (get number kb!) different social networking sites at the click of a button
