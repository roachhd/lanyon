### Question & Answer

**Question 1. What is the Internet?**

   The Internet is an interconnected computer network on a global scale that uses the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices. It consists of millions of private, public, organisational, academic, business, and government networks, linked by a massive infrastructure of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 

   The Internet provides a foundation to carry an extensive range of information resources and services such as text, graphics, voice, video, and computer programs and more. These are transmitted via HTTP and through a web browser.

   In addition to HTML, it's common for websites to use technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to render to visual style of a website and JavaScript for more advanced functionality.The World Wide Web is an ever growing collection of these HTML documents which reside on web servers. The interlinked documents that make up the World Wide Web are accessed via the Internet.

**question 4. What are three purported differences between the World Wide Web as it first emerged, and the more recent Web 2.0?**

   With Web 1.0 there was limited interaction between sites and web users, they were simply an information portal where users were provided with information. There was little chance of interactive or participation. 

Static web pages were used mostly to build and display web pages in 1990 when the World Wide Web first emerged. Unlike the highly interactive and social networks of today, participation by users was limited mostly to retrieval of information. 
Today with Web 2.0 user engagement and participation is at the forefront of development. 

   Social networks, RSS feeds and blogging have transformed the web into a global community for content sharing, collaborating, and immunisation. Web 2.0 encourages user participation and provides rich user experiences and ability to contribute.


**Three major Differences**

Web 1.0  | Web 2.0
-------- | ------
Static   | Interactive/rich
Readable | Writable 
company controlled | user controlled

**Question 5. What is RSS and why is it significant to Web 2.0?**

   The simplest definition of RSS is an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format that uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for representing information about resources on the World Wide Web (Dâ€™Souza, n.d., p.6).

   RSS removes the content from the formatting of a website and allows it to be displayed in other way and inside other formats. The ability to draw from other sources is a core feature of many social networking sites like FB, with its embedded ability to link to flickr and youtube for photos and video, but also means that the information can be viewed in different ways, and in a time saving manner. RSS changes the relationship between the user and the information they want access to.

   Once you have your Feed Reader, it is a matter of finding sites that syndicate content and adding their RSS feed to the list of feeds your Feed Reader checks. Many sites display a small icon with the acronyms RSS, XML, or RDF to let you know a feed is available.
