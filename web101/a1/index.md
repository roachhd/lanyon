### Assignment 1: Exercise - Short Question & Answers

##### In Brief:

This assignment is worth 15% of your mark for this unit.
Please refer to the [calendar](uni/cal/) or the [unit outline](/uni/web101/unit-outline.md) due date.

##### Instructions:

Please answer all of the following questions. Each answer should be a paragraph in length, and the maximum total word length for the assignment is 750 words.

1. [What is the Internet](/uni/web101/a1/q1/)?

2. [What is the World Wide Web](/uni/web101/a1/q2)?

3. [What is the relationship between the World Wide Web and the Internet](/uni/web101/a1/q3)?

4. [What are three purported differences between the World Wide Web as it first emerged, and the more recent Web 2.0](/uni/web101/a1/q4)?

5. [What is RSS and why is it significant to Web 2.0](/uni/web101/a1/q5)?


The word length averages out to 150 words for each answer, which is sufficient to answer each question, but only if you write concisely.  One of the challenges of short word-lengths is making sure you avoid any unnecessary material and get straight to your main points.  Since the overall assignment is worth 15 marks, this means that each question is worth 3 marks.  It follows that for each question there are (at least) three full and distinct points you should be making.  Since there is probably a lot more than three points possible for each question, you need to select what you think are the three most important points.  Being clear and concise is the key to doing well in this assignment.

You must clearly indicate all references and sources for the material informing your answers using in-text citations and a clearly marked References list at the end of your assignment. Any material you refer to  from written sources, online, or anywhere must be clearly indicated; all of your references should follow the APA style of citation. 

### Criteria for Assessment

Students will be assessed on how well your assignment:

- Concisely and comprehensively answers each question
- Presents answers clearly
- Follows conventions of referencing (APA), grammar and expression appropriate for an academic writing
- Explains basic technical foundations of the Internet and related technologies as they apply to communications and collaboration
