## Assignment 2: Essay

### In Brief:

This assignment is worth 35% of your mark for this unit.
Please refer to the calendar in your Unit Outline for the due date.

### Instructions:

Essay Question: Choose one Web 2.0 platform discussed during module two and analyse the extent to which this platform has changed the way people communicate and collaborate.

The Web 2.0 platforms specifically discussed in module two are Delicious, blogs, wikis (in general), The Wikipedia, Twitter, Flickr, Facebook and YouTube.  However, if you have discussed other Web 2.0 platforms during the unit in tutorials or on the discussion board, you may select this platform if it is approved by your tutor at least one week before the essay is due.  

*The word limit for this essay, excluding the reference list, is 1500 words.*

This essay asks you to analyse one of the Web 2.0 platforms that you’ve been examining in the unit, looking in particular at how that particular platform has changed the way in which users/participants both communicate and collaborate.  Given the context in which you’re examining these technologies, it is a good idea to think about how Web 2.0 in general is thought to indicate a general shift in the character of online interactions and use these changes to help think about your chosen platform.  You will be expected to use some of the readings/viewings provided in the unit, but you will also need to seek out appropriate secondary material.  When selecting useful secondary material, please ensure you select credible sources which appropriate for the platform you are addressing and the broader academic context in which you are examining that platform.

Please keep in mind that your essay should include a fully formed introduction and conclusion, should be written in paragraph form, should present a clear argument and should meaningfully engage with both readings/viewings provided in the unit and include credible material from secondary sources.  Your essay should follow the APA referencing style. You must clearly indicate all references and sources for the material informing your essay using in-text citations and a clearly marked References list at the end of your assignment.
