Week 6  5-Jan | Essay Writing and Perspectives, Reflecting on Module 1 |   
Week 7 12-Jan | Power and Economy | Both these topics are closely linked and important for your last two assignments. So while the topics are broken into separate weeks try to focus on all four concepts of Power, Economy, Community and Identity across this fortnight. Week 7 continue to work on your second assignment: identifying materials, reading, thinking about and writing your essay plan. Share any other reading you find with others through the discussion boards. These four themes are an important part of your final essay, so you want to use the time to understanding how these link back to the topics in Module 1. Teaching break in Week 9, use this time to revise your work and focus on your Learning Portfolio and refresh your understanding of what to submit for Part 2 of this assessment.

Week 12 16-Feb | Reflecting on the Unit and Conclusion | In these two weeks we start by looking back on Module 2. In the last four weeks there have been some very broad topics covered. This reflection module gives us a chance to look back and draw links between these topics. This is also the time to put the final touches on your final essay. The final week looks back at the unit as a whole and offers a chance to speculate about the future of the Internet and everyday life. During this period you will also be invited to give feedback on the unit through eVALUate.
