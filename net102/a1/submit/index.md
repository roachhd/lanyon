##### Question 1.
**How has the move from an analogue to digital medium changed the distribution and consumption of music?**

   Music has gone through some massive changes with the introduction of digital technologies. The production of sounds, the distribution and consumption, and the broader music industry have been transformed. From access, portability of equipment, quality of media and files, as well as the ease of piracy. With this change brings a major power shift where we can all be consumers and producers.

   By 2000, MP3's and peer-to-peer file sharing services like Napster made it possible to download digital copies of songs. MP3 players like iPods and smartphones have replaced the analogue devices and enable instant listening. Today it is possible for a countless number of songs to "be compressed and stored on a pocket sized machine" Laughey (2007)(pg.78) for consumption.

   These rapid changes have transformed the broader music industry. Anyone with a computer and internet connection can become a worldwide sensation, and huge artists can be financially disadvantaged by the streaming and unlawful distribution of their music. 

   A transformation in consumer attitudes have also occurred. Music is instant. Everything is now on demand. Even the ability to gain access to music prior to official release dates has greatly increased. As a result of these digital advancements, increased consumption and ease of distribution, music is further ingrained in our everyday lives.

**Question 2.**
**What are the differences that Brooks observes between gaming in Korea and the United States? How does this compare to your experience of gaming?**

   Brooks (2008) writes of no stigma attached with gaming in Korea and that it has become a regular form of entertainment in Korean life. In a fairly stark contrast, the United Stated still holds on to the stigma attached to the gamer life. Brooks claims that this stigma, along with technology infrastructure have been at the forefront of PC gaming popularity in Korea, "enabled by the high-speed internet access and a desire to play socially" Brooks (2008). Brooks fails to mention the ban of Japanese cultural products in Korea, subsequently this meant video games and consoles were never marketed in Korea, until, as Dal Yong Jin (2011) describes, "the ban was lifted in 1998" . By this time, PC gaming and networking was already deep set in the Korea way of life, the ban most certainly has been a major contributor to PC gaming popularity. this is supported by the number of PC Bangs (gaming cafes) in Korea, "There are currently over 20,000 active PC bangs in South Korea and they have become an integral part of the countryâ€™s social fabric and cultural landscape." Ping ZhouSouth (2015).

   My experience gaming has been a mostly of consoles and mobile devices. I own 2 PCs, a laptop, a new3DSXL, a iPad, a Wii and WiiU, and a number of mobiles and tablet with various operating systems. When I play games I spend most of my time on a WiiU, which is representative of what Brooks (2008) has suggested. Of more recent times I have started looking at the more social aspects of the games, although I am hesitant to have my gaming life cross over into my social network profiles.

**Question 5.**
**In what ways has the Internet changed the relationship between politicians and the citizens they govern.**

   Politicians, through social media and the Internet, have a greater global reach to convey their political views. A new form of campaigning, to better reach voters that were previously hard to access due to geography. The Internet also allows political supporters to vice their opinions to a broader audience.  It is true to say "it has rewritten the rules on how to reach voters, raise money, organize supporters, manage the news media, track and mold public opinion, and wage - and withstand - political attacks". Adam Nagourney (2008)

In 2007 John Howard launched into the social network world with a policy announcement on YouTube. "Within 48 hours of the original video being posted, the entry of â€˜John Howardâ€™ and â€˜Climate changeâ€™ into YouTube or Google could lead you to a veritable potpourri of online postings, to the extent that it took several page views to reach the original climate change statement." Showing social networking could also prove to be detrimental to a campaign.

"By contrast, the ALP came to the 2007 federal election with a highly sophisticated online media strategy." The Kevin07 campaign was further proof that the Internet has changed the relationship between politicians and citizens.
