##### Question 1.
**How has the move from an analogue to digital medium changed the distribution and consumption of music?**

   Consumption and distribution of music has gone through some massive changes with the introduction of digital technologies. The production of sounds, the distribution and consumption, and the broader music industry, have been transformed. From access, portability of equipment, quality of media and files, as well as the greater ease of piracy. With this change brings a power shift where we can all be consumers and producers.

   By 2000, MP3's and peer-to-peer file sharing services like Napster made it possible to download digital copies of songs. MP3 players like iPods and smartphones have replaced the analogue devices and enable instant listening. Today it is possible for a countless number of songs to "be compressed and stored on a pocket sized machine" Laughey (2007)(pg.78) for consumption.

   These rapid changes have transformed the broader music industry. Anyone with a computer and internet connection can become a worldwide sensation, and huge artists can be financially disadvantaged by the streaming and unlawful distribution of their music. 

   A transformation in consumer attitudes have also occurred. Music is instant. Everything is now on demand. Even the ability to gain access to music prior to official release dates has greatly increased. As a result of these digital advancements, increased consumption and ease of distribution, music is further ingrained in our everyday lives.
