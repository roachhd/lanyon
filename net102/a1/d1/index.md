# Question 1.
How has the move from an analogue to digital medium changed the distribution and consumption of music?

   The introduction of digital technologies have transformed the distribution and consumption, and the broader music industry. Anyone with a computer and internet connection can become a worldwide sensation, and huge artists can be hurt by the streaking and unlawful distribution of their music. Even the increases in quality of recordings, especially when sharing. 
Big changes to instant gratification, everything is on demand. Even me releases can usually be accessed prior to the official release dates. You don't have to wait for anything, you can try before you buy. Gone are they days of being disappointed that only the his date the good songs on an album.  Does this hurry or help artists. Initially yes, but it has opened the door for a new breed of artists, the average Joe. 

   I think the music industry overreacted to the digital era, and Judy need to figure out how to use it to their advantage, which many artists have. (reference to some artists that have done well with digital treeless- radio head) don't have made our choices (reference to U2 could album disaster)
The shifts have been in line with social and cultural patterns.



**Question 5.**
**In what ways has the Internet changed the relationship between politicians and the citizens they govern.**

Politicians, through social media and the Internet, have a greater global reach to convey their political views. A new form of campaigning, to better reach voters that were previously hard to access due to geography. The Internet also allows political supporters to vice their opinions to a broader audience.  It is true to say “it has rewritten the rules on how to reach voters, raise money, organize supporters, manage the news media, track and mold public opinion, and wage — and withstand — political attacks”.
