**50%** NET102 Assignment 3: Learning Portfolio

###### In Brief:

This assignment is worth 30% of your mark for this unit.

This, and other assignments, is to be submitted via the Blackboard-Turnitin assignment upload tool before the due time.

###### Instructions

This assignment is made up of two parts: your Ongoing Portfolio which is written throughout the unit, and
 contains your reflections on tasks and discussions each week; and the second part is titled the Learning
 Portfolio--and this is the part you submit to your tutor. Here, you present a selection of your entries along with a short piece reflecting on your overall learning in the unit.

 Your Ongoing Portfolio is to facilitate your learning during the unit, but you are not required to submit the whole
 Ongoing Portfolio. On the due date you only submit the document described in Part Two.

## Part One: **Ongoing Portfolio**

Part One is weekly preparation that is not submitted to the tutor as a whole:
 Each week of the unit contains one or more tasks, which are either activities or responses to readings. You are required to complete these readings and activities as indicated. You will also participate in various learning conversations, either on the discussion boards, using online tools, or (for on-campus students) in face-to-face tutorials. In order to summarise, analyse and critically reflect on your learning throughout the unit, each week you are asked to create a portfolio entry in which narrates your critical thinking on either a task or conversation from that week. You may write as much as you like on as many tasks or conversations as you like, but the important thing is to write enough to ensure you focus and reflect on what you have learnt and how you have learnt each week.

The portfolio is intended to be primarily useful to you (not your tutor) so choose topics which most interest you and write it in whatever format you like - you can keep it as a word document on your computer, a personal wiki or in your own blog. You are most welcome to share your portfolio with others in the unit if you wish (however, there is no requirement to do so). You are not required to submit your whole portfolio for assessment, but rather will submit a selection of portfolio entries which best demonstrate your learning in the unit, which is explained in Part Two.

## Part Two: **Learning Portfolio**

This is what you end up submitting to your tutor via Blackboard.
 You present your tutor with extracts of your ongoing portfolio in a document, which can be up to a maximum length of 1200 words. 
This document includes:
- Section A: 300 words explaining (in brief) why the entries in Section B were selected and how they (and/or other activities, readings and discussions) have contributed to your understanding of the Internet and its place in contemporary society.
- Section B: 3 of your 'best' portfolio entries, with the topic and activity as subheadings. There should be at least one entry each from Module 1 and 2 (e.g. you may have two from Module 1, one from Module 2, or vice versa).

**Tip**: pay attention to the criteria for assessment below when preparing this submission.

You must clearly indicate all references and sources for the material informing your answers. Any material you refer to from written sources, online, or anywhere must be clearly indicated; all of your references should follow the APA style of citation. Your reference list does not count towards your word count.

All university work needs to indicate clearly, and using a set format to do so, whenever another source is being used. This includes: using the wording of another person, paraphrasing or drawing on information and ideas from another source (even if reworded). Also review the unit outline regarding university policies around assessment.
