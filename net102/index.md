### **Assessments**

###### Summary of Assessment

The assessment in this unit is designed, first and foremost to assist you to learn and, then, to reward you by giving you opportunities to demonstrate your learning. Assessment is tightly connected with the syllabus outlined above. In return for your commitment to high-quality work and timely presentation, we will make sure that feedback for each assignment is prompt, giving you opportunity to improve for the next assignment.

There are four components to assessment in this unit. 

- [Assignment 1](/a1/) Questions and Answers 10% finally due Monday Week 5, 5:00 pm* 
- [Assignment 2](/a2/) Essay Plan 10% due Friday Week 7, 5:00 pm 
- [Assignment 3](/a3) Learning Portfolio 30% finally due Monday Week 10, 5:00 pm* 
- [Assignment 4](/a4/)  Essay 50% due Monday Week 13, 5:00 pm 
 
**Note**: Assignment 1 & 3 both start in the second week and involve weekly writing and participation until the due dates.  It is your responsibility to manage your time during the study period and ensure you do not leave too much work for the final weeks.

You will pass the unit as long as you submit all pieces of work, make satisfactory efforts to attend and participate, obtain a grade of 50% or more for all the assessment (i.e. you may fail any individual piece of work as long as your final result is 50% or more).  You are not permitted to resubmit assignments once already submitted.

For this unit, all assignments are to be submitted via the Assignments page linked from the left menu of Blackboard. If you experience problems, try a different browser, for instance, Firefox, for some reason, has been found in the past to not work very well with this part of Blackboard--if you find this the case, use Internet Explorer.
