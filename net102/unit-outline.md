### Description

For many people, their everyday life now involves constant interaction with the internet. Indeed the internet is becoming an almost invisible part of these experiences. As cyberspace and real space come together, it is easy to miss the effects of the internet on us and our society. Through several specific topics - such as dating, music, games, faith, health and politics - this unit will help you to investigate the internet from various perspectives and across a range of experiences. You will also learn to analyse the internet conceptually, understanding how technology and society intertwine.
